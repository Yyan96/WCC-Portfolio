        <h1>Week 3: Data Scrape</h1>
        <p>I was very confused by the 'Web Scrap' I learnt this week and didn't understand the point of doing it. At first, I used
            Node_Web_Scrape_Simple to scrap Wikipedia, but the content appeared as a long string of words and garbled characters.
            I wanted the text to be in paragraph form, so I used array[]. But the content was still very long. Later, 
            with the help of a classmate, I used split(".") with "." to form a new paragraph. 
            Then I combined the Node-Web-Scrape-Images code for image scraping with the code I'm using now so that it scrapes the text and the image. 
            But I still need to implement how to scrap images with specific names.
            
            I don't know if I understand this correctly, but I thought the double quotes in "if(src.indexOf("https:") == -1)" represented what was being scraped,
             but I found that when I changed https: to .png, the saved image was only in jpg format. I need more time to learn how scraping images work.
