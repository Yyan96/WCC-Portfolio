        <h1>Week 3: Data Scrape</h1>
        <p>IAt first, I wanted to be able to scrap specific images rather than all the images 
          displayed on the Wikipedia entry page, but that idea didn't work out. However, I can 
          use "if(src.indexOf("https:") == -1)" to filter the image format I want. 
          I think it would be fun to make a random collage of images scraped from the page，
          like the one shown below， and then appear with the text, like a drawing diary.
